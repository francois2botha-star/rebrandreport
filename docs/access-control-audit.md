# RolloutHQ Access Control Audit

This document audits the current app functionality and explains which user roles can be assigned, what each role can do by default, and which capabilities Francois and Beverley can enable or disable per user from the restricted Access Controls page.

## Restricted Administration Page

- Page: `/access-controls`
- Visible only to: `francois@colourpix.co.za`, `bd@colourpix.co.za`, and `beverley@colourpix.co.za`
- Source of users: Supabase `profiles`
- Stored controls: `profiles.role` and `profiles.permission_overrides`
- Important note: role assignment is the default access model; per-user toggles are exceptions layered over the assigned role.

## Assignable Roles

| Role key | Display name | Intended users | Default scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `colourpix_admin` | Workspace Administrator | Colourpix administrators | Full workspace operations, users, projects, files, reports, workflow, and settings |
| `psg_head_office` | Client Administrator | PSG head office users | All PSG workspace projects, approval-related workflow, reports, files, questions, and comments |
| `psg_branch_manager` | Site Contact | Branch managers and site contacts | Assigned branch/site projects, questions, file access, and reports |
| `sign_company` | Delivery Partner | Installers and delivery partners | Assigned installer projects, installation-stage workflow, files, comments, and tasks |

Every user must have exactly one assigned role. A user is never role-less; to remove a capability, keep the role and switch off the relevant capability override.

## Timeline Calculation

Timeline stages now use three practical states:

- Done: checked stage
- Busy: the current active unchecked stage
- Open: unchecked future stage

All users who can view a project can tick or untick timeline stages. When a stage is changed, the project recalculates:

- `currentStage`: first unchecked stage, or `Completed` when all stages are checked
- `status`: `completed` when all stages are checked, `awaiting_approval` when the busy stage is Awaiting Approval, otherwise `busy`
- `progress`: checked stage count divided by total timeline stages

This supports reversing work. For example, if Artwork Sent is unticked because artwork was sent back, that stage becomes the Busy stage and progress drops accordingly.

## Supabase Schema Notes

The restricted Access Controls page needs this profile column:

```sql
alter table public.profiles add column if not exists permission_overrides jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb;
```

The Busy status requires the projects status check constraint to allow `busy`. The repository schema has been updated, but a live database with an existing check constraint may need a migration to drop and recreate that constraint.
